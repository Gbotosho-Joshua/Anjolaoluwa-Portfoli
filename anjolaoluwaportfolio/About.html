            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Anjolaoluwa, the second one of triplets,  I am a 200 level Theatre Arts student of Redeemers University. I am 17 and an aspiring model and an aspiring Director.  <br> <br>
                I believe fashion is life and a work of art, it expresses emotions and different things the mouth cannot say. <br> <br>
                My favourite color is gray because it signifies nature and grace and flourish also calmness and purity.
